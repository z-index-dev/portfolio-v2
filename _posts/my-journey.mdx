One of the great things about software development is the community's pervasive, inherent desire to help each other. We are our brother's keeper in this industry. No matter the language, bug or general crossroads that you come across in development, it's a virtual guarantee that you'll be able to find at least one resource that will point you in the right direction.

For reasons I won't lay out here, 2024 has been one of the hardest years of my life and it's kept me from updating this blog as often as I'd like. In spite of that, I'm proud to say that I have been promoted to Lead Engineer of my team, which is an achievement I wouldn't have thought possible when I started "My Journey" as a self-taught developer.

I've shared the Cliff's Notes of the eponymous title of this post on Twitter (no, I'm not calling it that other thing). But in light of the year I've had and the goal I've reached, I wanted to share a bit more detail and express the gratitude I have for the community that dragged me through a lot of the process.

## Why I Wanted to Be a Developer

I actually didn't want to be a developer. At least at first I didn't.

Back in 2018, I was working for the Houston Rockets building sales decks for sponsorship salesmen. In a lot of ways, this was a dream job for me. I had always wanted to work in sports, freaking _love_ the Rockets, worked with awesome people and went to all the basketball games I could handle.

However, it was really difficult for me to figure out what was next. I was good at PhotoShop, but worked with actual graphic designers that were much better than I could ever hope to be. I didn't want to sell, nor did I want to manage accounts. My 20s were coming to an end, and I felt really stuck.

At one point, I pursued a job without another team in Michigan and realized that not only did I have no idea what I was going to do with my life, I had no real control over my life at all. If I stayed in sports and wanted to grow, I would have to take whatever job was offered in whichever place it was and hope I shined through.

That didn't sound like the life I wanted, so I decided to take a hard look at my options.

## How I Started Learning

One thing I noticed in my job working in sponsorship was how much easier it was to build pitch decks for companies that had good websites. It was easy to find their mission, snag a high-quality logo and generally figure out what they were about.

So there it was - I'm going to be a web designer. That sounds like something that pays well, has some flexibility and should have plenty of future opportunities.

I was excited by this idea. And a quick Google search told me there were these bootcamps I could do for a decent chunk of change that would get me where I wanted to go in only six months! So I filled out a form, talked to some people on the phone and was ready to take the plunge into the world of coding bootcamps.

Here enters one of the first heroes of my story - the Rockets' very own developer, who managed the team's site as a team of one. He and I had a good working relationship, so I decided to pick his brain about my new life plan.

In the moment, what he told me probably disappointed me more than anything else. While he was super enthusiastic I was interested in what he did, he cautioned me against my 6-month, get-web-designer-skills-quick scheme. He said I'd be better off learning on my own at first, and if I loved it, then a bootcamp would always be willing to take my money.

Back to the drawing board.
