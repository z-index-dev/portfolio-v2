            When I was still in college, I took a sports blogging job with
            Bleacher Report that I stuck with for five years. While I don't miss
            that hustle at all, I still enjoy writing and am excited to have
            this space as part of my personal site.

            I'm sure I'll deviate somewhere down the line, but my immediate goal
            here is to provide some insight into career growth and how to
            improve as a developer. This is an overlooked part of the wide world
            of tech blogging, and I hope you find something that connects with
            where you are as a software engineer.
